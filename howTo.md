# How to start a web server

[SnowCrash.iso](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/isos/SnowCrash.iso)

1. Download [the image](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/isos/SnowCrash.iso)
2. Go to that folder and convert the downloaded image to a format supported by VirtualBox:
```
VBoxManage convertfromraw --format VDI SnowCrash.iso SnowCrash.vdi

```

3. Run VirtualBox
	- click "New" button

	- Choose "Use an existing virtual hard disk drive" -> Click "Add" button

	- choose SnowCrash.vdi -> "Open" -> "Choose" 
	- fill "Name" field (snowcrash) and type "Create".

4. **Create a new host-only adapter in VirtualBox**. Create the Virtual Network. First, you must set up a virtual network that the host-only adapter(s) will communicate through.

	- In the VirtualBox window, click File -> Host Network Manager -> Create.

	- Check Enable under the DHCP Server column of the network you just created.

	- Select your network and click Properties.

	- In the Adapter Tab, select Configure Adapter Manually and use the following settings:
	```
	IPv4 Address: 192.168.56.1
	IPv4 Network Mask: 255.255.255.0
	```
	- In the DHCP Server Tab, make sure that Enable Server box is checked, and use the following settings:
	```
	Server Address: 192.168.56.100
	Server Mask: 255.255.255.0
	Lower Address Bound: 192.168.56.3
	Upper Address Bound: 192.168.56.254
	```
	- Click Apply and then Close

5. **Add a Host-Only Adapter to the Guest Machine.** For each guest you want to communicate with using the network from the previous step, you need to add a host-only adapter.

	- Select the appropriate guest machine (override)

	- Click Settings -> –êudio
	```
	Enable Audio: Unchecked
	```

	- Click Settings -> Network

	- Under the Adapter tab, input the following settings:
	```
	Enable Network Adapter: Checked
	Attached to: Host-Only Adapter
	Name: vboxnet0 (NOTE: this should be the name of the network you created in the previous steps)
	In "Promiscuous Mode" select "Allow VMs"
	```

	- Click OK

	The host-only adapter should be ready to use on this machine. 
	```
	If you would like to network multiple machines together, repeat steps this paragraph 5 for each guest machine.
	```

6. Take shapshot of your VM

7. Launch VM. At the top menu of your VM choose "View" -> "Virtual screen 1" -> "Scale to 275%" and get the IP address to be audited

8. That's all. Next step you will do on your Mac: type this IP address into terminal (?) and audit it. 

Good luck!
